easier to have multiple versions of a code base,
sometimes across multiple developers or teams

## What is Github ?

• Github.com is a website that hosts git repositories on a
remote server

• Hosting repositories on Github facilitates the sharing of
codebases among teams by providing a GUI to easily fork or
clone repos to a local machine

automatically create your own developer portfolio as well!
